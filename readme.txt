== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to filter the query from this plugin =
You can use `rpwe_default_query_arguments`

= Thumbnail size option not working properly =
Yes, this is because the plugin uses `the_post_thumbnail` custom sizes and not uses `add_image_size` function, [more information](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail). At the moment I have no idea how to fix this issue.

= How to set a custom style as default =
Define your styles in rpwe_custom.css at your theme folder. You may use includes/rpwe.css as template.
This way your custom style will remain even if there's an update to this plugin.
